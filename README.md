### What is Carpe Diem?
Carpe Diem is a **productivity journal app** for the day. It aims to keep the user focused on the present by limiting planning to one day.

Carpe Diem allows the user to **create a to-do list** for the day. Anything that has not been completed for the current day will be carried over the next day, though the user has the option to either keep past objectives or delete them.

Carpe Diem also has a **journaling feature** that allows the user to add descriptions to items in the to-do list.

### Why is it important and interesting?
This app keeps the user focused with what they need to do for the day. Instead of having a weekly planner or a monthly planner, the user is limited to a daily planner so that their focused on *one* thing, seizing the day. 

This app aims to limit procrastination by not allowing the user to plan ahead, only allowing them to focus on what needs to be done that day.

### What language/tools/technology do we plan to use?

### What will be the input/output of our project?
