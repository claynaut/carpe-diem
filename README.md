### What is Carpe Diem?
Carpe Diem is a **productivity journal app** for the day. It aims to keep the user focused on the present by limiting planning to one day.

Carpe Diem allows the user to **create a to-do list** for the day. Anything that has not been completed for the current day will be carried over the next day, though the user has the option to either keep past objectives or delete them.

Carpe Diem has a **journaling feature** that allows the user to add descriptions to items in the to-do list.

Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, Carpe Diem has **two built-in timers** that allows the user to set aside a certain amount of time for working and taking a break. For instance, one timer can be set to 25 minutes of working and the other timer can be set to 5 minutes of taking a break. The timers will automatically run and repeat once the user activates them; once the work timer ends, it resets and the break timer starts.
